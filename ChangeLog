version 2.0.0-beta3
-------------------
* added basic remote commands support, currently only switch
between manual and dynamic mode
* added PRE/POST rule change events (I'll use it to implement
cpufreqd_exec plugin). Might also be helpful with nforce2 chipsets

version 2.0.0-beta2
-------------------
* fixed a simple bug with empty rules
* Valgrind is really happy! #allocs==#frees!!

version 2.0.0-beta1
-------------------
* fully refactored to support a better plugin infratructure. Now plugins can
be atomic wrt features and one can select single resources to monitor. More
plugins available, see docs for more.

version 1.2.0
-------------
* fixed APM battery presence detection (Mark Stier).
* prefer sysfs interface over proc (Dennis Nienhüser).
* support for extended /proc/stat information provided by 2.6 kernels (Holger
  Ruckdeschel).
* fixes possible divide by 0 while getting cpu usage (thanks to Holger
  Ruckdeschel).
* report better logs when scanning acpi dirs (libsys_init in libsys_acpi.c).
* add checks for empty config file.
* provide useful defaults for the general section.
* migrated to autotools 1.8.
* added multiple processors support (all processors updated with the same
  values).
* fixed libsys_acpi bad behavior when no ac_adapter and battery found, now
  cpufreqd is usable on desktops too, it considers always online a system with
  a missing ac_adapater directory.
* added translation between percentage/Hz-speed based on a patch from
  <rv@eychenne.org> (see http://bugs.debian.org/254418).

version 1.1.2
-------------
* added missing fclose in libsys_pmu
* fixed old gentoo scripts (wrong deamon path)
* fixed debian init script (missing arguments for cpufreqd start)

version 1.1.1
-------------
* fixed a bug in /proc/cpufreq writes handling (wrote the wrong separator
  thus failing to switch frequencies
* enhanced program matching, it now considers the base name found in 
  /proc/<pid>/cmdline (<plasmagunman@users.sourceforge.net>)

version 1.1
-----------
* fixed potential buffer overflows in config file parser
* fixed PPC bug (Dominik 'Aeneas' Schnitzer <dominik@schnitzer.at>)
* added Mandrake init file (Michael Scherer <scherer.michael@free.fr>)
* fixed pidfile permission on create (Michael Scherer
  <scherer.michael@free.fr>)
* fixed segfaults when some configuration options left blank
* changed cpufreqd.1 in cpufreqd.8 (seems more appropriate)
* changed default install dir to $sbindir as cpufreqd is a privileged
  executable
* fixed typos and missing information in manpages

version 1.1-rc1
---------------
* added support for Power Management Unit of Apple NewWorld systems
  (Rene Rebe <rene@rocklinux.org>)
* added cpu monitoring (base code by Dietz Proepper <dietz@rotfl.franken.de>)
* fixed HUP handler to reinitialize really _everything_
* varoius smaller fixes
