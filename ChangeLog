* make the acpi thermal comaptible with kernels >2.6.25 when the type has
changed from "ACPI Thermal Zone" to "acpitz"
* squash some converison warnings (gcc 4.3 is very loud about it)

* support reading the acpi battery status from charge_* attributes

version 2.3.2
-------------
* Fix damn stupid bug that made cpufreq spin forever if there is
no socket available and it is started with -m (manual mode)
* Fix some logging as well in acpi_battery

version 2.3.1
-------------
* even more silent about non fatal failures
* acpi_event more resitant to acpid dying, it tries to reopen 
the socket if it loses the connection

version 2.3.0
-------------
* use sysfs acpi class devices to read system status (/proc is not supported
anymore, if you don't want't to switch to /sys do not install this version of
cpufreqd)
* rescan batteries on acpi events
* fix invalid profile checking

version 2.2.1
-------------
* Fix CMD_CUR_PROFILES or better, fix current_profile traking

  accordingly

version 2.2.0
-------------
* SMP/SMT awareness in profiles/rules settings and cpu_plugin
* added TAU plugin for G3 processors temperature monitoring
* add "-l" switch to cpufreqd-get to list current profile for each CPU
  NOTE: the current profile is not reported with simply `cpufreqd-get`
* deal with unfair bioses which change frequency (and locks 
  it for some time) behind our back
* restore reading /proc/<pid>/cmdline instead of /p/<p>/exe and try to
  normalize the process name
* do not set a Rule as "current" if it fails to apply

version 2.1.1
-------------
* fixed incorrect use of va_args in cpufreqd_log
* fix acpi_ac to not rely on acpi_events to poll the ac status
* acpi: do not depend (that much) on acpi_events

version 2.1.0
-------------
* grouped some useful info in struct cpufreqd_info to let plugins peek important data
* added -m switch to start cpufreqd in manual mode
* reset timer when entering manual mode
* forcing update when exiting manual mode
* sanitized set/reset of SIGALRM
* added cpufreqd_exec plugin
* added cpufreqd_acpi_event plugin
* added cpufreqd_governor_parameters plugin
* merged all ACPI plugins into one to let them cohoperate (eg: wait for events)
* acpi_battery now can read /proc/acpi files at longer intervals and estimates
battery level in between them
* acpi_ac waits for ACPI events instead of polling

version 2.0.0
-------------
* 2.0.0 final
* fix an incorrect printf format that caused to SIGSEGV on 64bit platforms
* make cpufreqd al little more conservative when choosing a rule by 
keeping an already applied rule in case of a tie

version 2.0.0-pre2
-------------------
* fixed leak in nvclock plugin (note that you still need to patch
nvclock as a problem was found there also)
* code cleanup in config_parser.c
* enabled subsecond poll_interval
* fixed SIGSEGV when duplicate rules found
* avoid configuring the same plugin twice

version 2.0.0-pre1
-------------------
* implemented backward compatibility for the configuration file
format (great!!)
* automatically load plugins (if not configured) and rely on plugins
initialization to probe the necessary stuff
* the configure script now accepts --enable/disable options for 
plugns that need some sort of special support
* ported the PMU plugin
* added sensors plugin (you'll need userspace libs from lm-sensors)
* fixed socket creation permissions
* added the ability to allow a certain group to read/write
to the socket
* fixed looots of bugs
* beautified logs
* the "cpu" directive was wrong, now named "cpu_interval"
run 'sed -i -e 's/^cpu=/cpu_interval=/' /etc/cpufreqd.conf'
to fix things. I'm sooooo sooorry...
* reworked plugins post-configuration (might drop it actually), now
plugins are correctly initialized even if their global section is missing

version 2.0.0-beta4
-------------------
* more remote commands supported
* nforce2-atxp1 supported bi nforce2 plugin
* reworked main loop to use SIGALARM
* moved a bunch of code into functions to improve readability
* included 2 sample remote clients in utils/ with manpages
* various corrections to manpages
* complete event infrastructure, now plugins can hook into
profiles as well as have their own configuration section
* fixed a bunch of bugs and errors

version 2.0.0-beta3
-------------------
* added basic remote commands support, currently only switch
between manual and dynamic mode
* added PRE/POST rule change events (I'll use it to implement
cpufreqd_exec plugin). Might also be helpful with nforce2 chipsets

version 2.0.0-beta2
-------------------
* fixed a simple bug with empty rules
* Valgrind is really happy! #allocs==#frees!!

version 2.0.0-beta1
-------------------
* fully refactored to support a better plugin infratructure. Now plugins can
be atomic wrt features and one can select single resources to monitor. More
plugins available, see docs for more.

version 1.2.0
-------------
* fixed APM battery presence detection (Mark Stier).
* prefer sysfs interface over proc (Dennis Nienhüser).
* support for extended /proc/stat information provided by 2.6 kernels (Holger
  Ruckdeschel).
* fixes possible divide by 0 while getting cpu usage (thanks to Holger
  Ruckdeschel).
* report better logs when scanning acpi dirs (libsys_init in libsys_acpi.c).
* add checks for empty config file.
* provide useful defaults for the general section.
* migrated to autotools 1.8.
* added multiple processors support (all processors updated with the same
  values).
* fixed libsys_acpi bad behavior when no ac_adapter and battery found, now
  cpufreqd is usable on desktops too, it considers always online a system with
  a missing ac_adapater directory.
* added translation between percentage/Hz-speed based on a patch from
  <rv@eychenne.org> (see http://bugs.debian.org/254418).

version 1.1.2
-------------
* added missing fclose in libsys_pmu
* fixed old gentoo scripts (wrong deamon path)
* fixed debian init script (missing arguments for cpufreqd start)

version 1.1.1
-------------
* fixed a bug in /proc/cpufreq writes handling (wrote the wrong separator
  thus failing to switch frequencies
* enhanced program matching, it now considers the base name found in 
  /proc/<pid>/cmdline (<plasmagunman@users.sourceforge.net>)

version 1.1
-----------
* fixed potential buffer overflows in config file parser
* fixed PPC bug (Dominik 'Aeneas' Schnitzer <dominik@schnitzer.at>)
* added Mandrake init file (Michael Scherer <scherer.michael@free.fr>)
* fixed pidfile permission on create (Michael Scherer
  <scherer.michael@free.fr>)
* fixed segfaults when some configuration options left blank
* changed cpufreqd.1 in cpufreqd.8 (seems more appropriate)
* changed default install dir to $sbindir as cpufreqd is a privileged
  executable
* fixed typos and missing information in manpages

version 1.1-rc1
---------------
* added support for Power Management Unit of Apple NewWorld systems
  (Rene Rebe <rene@rocklinux.org>)
* added cpu monitoring (base code by Dietz Proepper <dietz@rotfl.franken.de>)

* varoius smaller fixes
