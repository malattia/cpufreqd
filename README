cpufreqd-2.0.0-beta5
====================

************
*   NOTE   *
************

This is a beta release! Things may not work as you expect, use this software at
your own risk.
After this scary disclaimer let me tell you that the status of cpufreqd is not
that bad actually. Valgrind seems pretty happy with it, so no memory leaks and
my laptop and desktop PC are pretty happy and running quite cool in this hot
italian summer :)
Note however that I had a couple of reports of cpufreqd not changing frequency
actually but I've not been able to reproduce that yet, I'd be really happy if
somebody experiencing this problem could put some light to it.
To be sure you don't have this problem use the "double_check" option in
cpufreqd.conf, it will make cpufreqd check that the requested policy has really
been set.

Also, cpufreqd now depends on libcpufreq from cpufrequtils, get it here[1] and
install it before building cpufreqd if you don't have that on your system
already.
It also contains 2 useful utilities that can be really helpful to check that
cpufreqd is behaving correctly.

Please report any bug and suggestion to <malattia@gmail.com>.

cpufreqd is meant to be a replacement of the speedstep applet you can find on
some other OS, it monitors cpu usage, battery level, AC state and running
programs and adjusts the frequency governor according to a set of rules
specified in the config file (see cpufreqd.conf (5)).

You need a CPUFreq driver and either APM, ACPI (a recent version) or PMU enabled
in your kernel config in order for this deamon to work.

You can find a functional ACPI in kernels > 2.4.22-pre1 or as patches at
http://sf.net/projects/acpi while CPUFreq is available through recent  -ac
kernels (that include ACPI too) or as patches at
http://codemonkey.org.uk/projects/cpufreq.
