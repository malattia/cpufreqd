cpufreqd-2.0.0

Please report any bug and suggestion to <malattia@gmail.com>.

cpufreqd is meant to be a replacement of the speedstep applet you can find on
some other OS, it monitors cpu usage, battery level, AC state and running
programs and adjusts the frequency governor according to a set of rules
specified in the config file (see cpufreqd.conf (5)).

You need a CPUFreq driver and either APM, ACPI (a recent version) or PMU enabled
in your kernel config in order for this deamon to work.

You can find a functional ACPI in kernels > 2.4.22-pre1 or as patches at
http://sf.net/projects/acpi while CPUFreq is available through recent  -ac
kernels (that include ACPI too) or as patches at
http://codemonkey.org.uk/projects/cpufreq.
