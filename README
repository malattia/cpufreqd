cpufreqd-2.0.0
===============

************
*   NOTE   *
************
Cpufreqd2 now provides all the features of cpufreqd1 plus a lot more! The 
configuration file format is still compatible but will emit a lot of warnings
if you still use the old format. Take a look at the cpufreqd.conf manpage to see
what changed.

For 2.0.0-beta4 users
---------------------
That version contained a bug in the cpufreqd_cpu plugin,
the directive name was (erroneously) "cpu" instead of "cpu_interval". Just run

	sed -i -e 's/^cpu=/cpu_interval=/' /etc/cpufreqd.conf

to fix things up. (The same happened for the apm plugin with 
"battery"/"battery_interval" but probably nobody tested it yet)

Note also that I had a couple of reports of cpufreqd not changing frequency
actually but I've not been able to reproduce that yet, I'd be really happy if
somebody experiencing this problem could put some light to it.
To be sure you don't have this problem use the "double_check" option in
cpufreqd.conf, it will make cpufreqd check that the requested policy has really
been set.

Last but not least, cpufreqd now depends on libcpufreq from cpufrequtils, get
it here[1] and install it before building cpufreqd if you don't have that on
your system already.
It also contains 2 useful utilities that can be really helpful to check that
cpufreqd is behaving correctly.

***********

Please report any bug and suggestion to <malattia@linux.it>.

cpufreqd is meant to be a replacement of the speedstep applet you can find on
some other OS, it monitors cpu usage, battery level, AC state and running
programs and adjusts the frequency governor according to a set of rules
specified in the config file (see cpufreqd.conf (5)).

You need a CPUFreq driver and either APM, ACPI (a recent version) or PMU enabled
in your kernel config in order for this deamon to work.

You can find a functional ACPI in kernels > 2.4.22-pre1 or as patches at
http://sf.net/projects/acpi while CPUFreq is available through recent  -ac
kernels (that include ACPI too) or as patches at
http://codemonkey.org.uk/projects/cpufreq.
