- configuration for each plugin (a section each)

- make cpufreqd really SMP aware: 
    each rule could address more than one policy telling a policy for each addressed cpu
      or
    policy is relative to one or more cpus
  CONS: complex configurations

- execute program after policy

- merge the manual-patch throught unix socket

- implement a delayed profile change or anyway smooth transitions by interpolation (possible?)

- parameter to choose _how_much_important_ are the niced processes

- rewrite manpages (!)

- write an autocpu rule/plugin
