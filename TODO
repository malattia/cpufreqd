- make cpufreqd really SMP aware: 
    each rule could address more than one policy telling a policy for each addressed cpu
      or
    policy is relative to one or more cpus
  CONS: complex configurations

- execute program after policy (will do in a plugin)

- implement a delayed profile change or anyway smooth transitions by interpolation (possible?)

- write an autocpu rule/plugin

- more plugins
