- correctly use "struct cpufreqd_info" still missing some information kept up to date

- cpufreqd_date

- merge cpufreqd_acpi_* into a single plugin to share useful data (now that event 
  is available one can avoid polling some devices)

- cpufreqd_cpu: make it aware of single cpu loads

------------
- make cpufreqd really SMP aware: 
    each rule could address more than one policy telling a policy for each addressed cpu
      or
    policy is relative to one or more cpus
  CONS: complex configurations

- implement a delayed profile change or anyway smooth transitions by interpolation (possible?)

- write an autocpu rule/plugin
