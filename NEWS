What's new in cpufreqd-2
------------------------

Cpufreqd 2 aims to become the next generation power management
daemon. It provides a common interface to enable system monitoring
and to take useful actions upon that.
Currently it is still centered on the CPUFreq kernel interface,
that means that running a CPUFreq capable kernel is still needed but
also that behaviour could be delegated to a plugin.

Note that the configuration file format is slightly incompatible 
with the previous cpufreqd 1 but it's really easy to migrate (a 
simple Perl script could do it, I'll try to prepare one soon).


Plugins status
--------------

* acpi_ac		OK
* acpi_battery		OK
* acpi_temperature	OK
* programs		OK
* cpu			OK
* nforce2		OK
* apm			Not tested, lacking HW (feedback is welcome)
* nvclock		Planned
* acpi_event		Planned
* sensors		Planned
* exec			Planned
* pmu			Planned, but no HW, will try to simple
			port the old plugin (any help is welcome)

If you have a good idea about a new plugin you'd like to see, try 
to talk with me, if I like it I could implement it (e.g: would you 
like a plugin that makes a Rule match the current datetime? or 
would like a plugin that switches your screen brightness when a
Rule mathces? I have other ideas but since most of the actions are
very specific to a single platform there might be many others and 
different ways to implement the same thing).
