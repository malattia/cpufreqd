Description: A speedstep applet clone
 cpufreqd is meant to be a replacement of the speedstep applet you
 can find on some other OS, it monitors CPU usage, battery level, AC 
 state and running programs and adjusts the frequency governor according
 to a set of rules specified in the config file.
 .
 You need a CPUFreq driver and either APM, ACPI (a recent version) or PMU
 enabled in your kernel in order for this daemon to work.
 You can find a functional ACPI in 2.4.22-pre1 or later or as patches at
 http://sf.net/projects/acpi while CPUFreq is available in 2.6 kernels or as
 patch at ftp://ftp.poupinou.org/cpufreq/.
