              README for Debian package of Cpufreqd
              =====================================

Configuration for cpufreqd is done automatically during install however the
configuration file created is very trivial and most of the time meaningless for
anybody's needs. Thus it's strongly suggested to modify the configuration and
restart cpufreqd after install.

Two examples are provided in /usr/share/doc/cpufreqd/examples.
